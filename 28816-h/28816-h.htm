<p>The Lady her handmaid to questioning took:<br />
&ldquo;Why dost thou so sickly and colourless look?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>But sorrow gnaws so sorely</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis little wonder if sickly I&rsquo;m
growing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Malfred my lady</i>!<br />
So much am I busied with cutting and sewing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Erewhile was thy cheek as the blooming rose red,<br />
But now thou art pale, even pale as the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To conceal the truth longer &rsquo;tis vain to
essay,<br />
My gallant young master has led me astray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the young noble has led thee astray,<br />
Say, what gave he thee for thy virtue in pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

o&rsquo;er,<br />
And them have I worn with affliction so sore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave to me also of silk a soft shift,<br />
And with sorrow most painful I&rsquo;ve worn the fair gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave me, Christ sain him! a gold ring so fine,<br />
Whose match I can see on no finger of thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will avail thee his presents of price,<br />
If he thee will not wed before God and men&rsquo;s
eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, he to espouse me so often has vowed,<br />
And rich presents beside upon me has bestowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will his vows help thee in secrecy spoke?<br />
To many a maid them he has made and has broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I on the gold harp will play me a tune,<br />
And the knight to his presence will summon me soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gallant young lord to his waiting-boy said:<br />
&ldquo;Go straight, and call hither my mother&rsquo;s fair
maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bedside he stroked with so gentle an air:<br />
&ldquo;Dear heart, sit thee down, for thy weight it will
bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, by the Saints, I will never do that,<br />
For there, noble Sir, I have ne&rsquo;er before sat.&rdquo;</p>

Thou hast slept in my arms embraced many a tide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My spouse thou shalt be, yea, my heart&rsquo;s beloved

And I in thine arms every night will repose.&rdquo;</p>

8</span>A TALE FROM THE CORNISH</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Lavan&rsquo;s parish once of yore,<br />
Dwelt on the spot called Tshei an Hor,<br />
A loving couple, man and wife,<br />
But poverty distressed their life.<br />
And thus the man his wife address&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wander forth of work in quest;<br />
And you, my dearest, you can earn<br />
Your living here till I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His home he leaves, and, far from gay,<br />
Towards the East he took his way.<br />
At length a farmer&rsquo;s dwelling reaching,<br />
He enter&rsquo;d it, for work beseeching.<br />
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;What work canst do?&rdquo; the farmer cried;<br />
&ldquo;All kinds of work, Sir,&rdquo; John replied.<br />
Then straight they for a year agree,<br />
Three pounds the wages were to be.</p>
<p>And when the year to end had come<br />
The master paid him down the sum.<br />
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said his master, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your
fee;<br />
But if you&rsquo;ll it return to me,<br />
A point of wisdom I will teach you.&rdquo;<br />
Said John: &ldquo;Give it me, I beseech you.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;No, no, to give is not my way.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;and say your
say.&rdquo;<br />
Quoth t&rsquo;other: &ldquo;This in memory hold:<br />
<i>Ne&rsquo;er for the new road leave the old</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They for another year agree,<br />
The wages just the same to be;<br />
And when the year its end had reached,<br />
The farmer forth the three pounds fetched.<br />
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said his master, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your
fee,<br />
But if you&rsquo;ll it return to me,<br />
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>A point of wisdom I will teach you.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Give it me, Sir, I do beseech you.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;For nought I will not speak, not I.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Well, take it then,&rdquo; was John&rsquo;s reply.<br />
Quoth t&rsquo;other: &ldquo;<i>Lodge not</i>, <i>for your
life</i>,<br />
<i>With an old man who&rsquo;s a young wife</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For yet a year they then agree,<br />
The wages still the same to be.<br />
And when the year to end had roll&rsquo;d,<br />
The three pounds out the master told.<br />
&ldquo;John,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your
fee;<br />
But if you&rsquo;ll it return to me,<br />
I&rsquo;ll the best point of wisdom learn you.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;For that, Sir, I&rsquo;ll the wage return you.&rdquo;<br
/>
The farmer said: &ldquo;<i>Take this advice</i>,<br />
<i>Ere striking once</i>, <i>bethink thee twice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now John would serve no longer there,<br />
Home to his wife he would repair.<br />
&ldquo;Go not to-day,&rdquo; the farmer spake,<br />
&ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s my wife&rsquo;s day to bake;<br />
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>She shall for you prepare a cake<br />
Home to your faithful wife to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nine pounds in the loaf they hid,<br />
And when John them adieu had bid,<br />
The farmer cried: &ldquo;I pray thee carry<br />
This present home unto your deary;<br />
And as ye two there merry make,<br />
Then, and not till then, part the cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John turned him homeward from the door;<br />
And when he reach&rsquo;d St. Eler&rsquo;s Moor,<br />
He met three Tre-ryn merchants there<br />
Returning home from Exeter.<br />
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re glad to see thee, John,&rdquo; they cried,<br
/>
&ldquo;Where hast thou been this long, long tide?&rdquo;<br />
Says John: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just from service come,<br />
And to my wife am journeying home.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;O travel with us,&rdquo; cried all three,<br />
&ldquo;And very welcome shalt thou be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before them two roads they behold;<br />
They took the new, John kept the old.<br />
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>And as they passed by Keou Tshoy Un,<br />
When they had just lost sight of John,<br />
Thieves set upon them furiously,<br />
Whereat they raised a doleful cry,<br />
Which reaching John&rsquo;s ears on his rout,<br />
&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thieves!&rdquo; he bellowed
out.</p>
<p>His clamour scared the robber train,<br />
Who from the merchants sped amain.<br />
And when they came to Market Jew<br />
They to their joy met John anew,<br />
And cried: &ldquo;What thanks we owe thee, John!<br />
We had for certain, every one,<br />
Been ruined people, but for thee,<br />
Come with us, thou&rsquo;lt most welcome be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when they reached the hostelrie<br />
At which it was their wont to lie,<br />
Quoth John: &ldquo;The master I must view.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;The master! what with him wouldst do?&rdquo;<br />
They answered, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve a mistress here,<br />
And young enough she is, and fair;<br />
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>To see the host, if you&rsquo;re inclined,<br />
Him in the kitchen you will find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into the kitchen John he goes,<br />
And sees the master of the house,<br />
An ancient man who turned the spit.<br />
&ldquo;O, ho!&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;this house I quit;<br />
No sleeping place of it I&rsquo;ll make,<br />
But in the next will quarters take.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Do not go yet,&rdquo; they cried all three,<br />
&ldquo;Stay, sup with us, thou&rsquo;lt welcome be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, with grief and shame, I say<br />
That with a friar of orders grey<br />
The mistress had contrived a plan<br />
To murder the poor ancient man,<br />
When sleep had bound the merchants fast,<br />
And on their heads the crime to cast.</p>
<p>John in the next house that same night<br />
Saw through a hole i&rsquo; the wall a light.<br />
So getting up and gently walking,<br />
He heard the friar and woman talking.<br />
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>The friar said: &ldquo;Against yon hole<br />
My back I&rsquo;ll set, for fear some soul<br />
From the next house our deeds should spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hostess then most cruelly,<br />
With a silk handkerchief she bore,<br />
Murdered her ancient husband poor,<br />
Strangled him did the accursed slut.<br />
But meanwhile through the hole John cut<br />
A round piece from the friar&rsquo;s gown,<br />
And then in bed again lay down.</p>
<p>At morn ran out the hostess crying<br />
That murdered was her husband lying;<br />
And since nor man nor child had been,<br />
Except the merchants, in the inn,<br />
They should be hanged withouten fail;<br />
They thereupon were led to jail.<br />
John quickly them a visit paid.<br />
&ldquo;O, John! we&rsquo;ve evil luck,&rdquo; they said;<br />
&ldquo;Last night the host was choked in bed,<br />
And upon us the crime is laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Dear gentlemen,&rdquo; was John&rsquo;s reply,<br
/>
&ldquo;Beseech the Justice instantly<br />
To cause them who the murder wrought<br />
Into his presence to be brought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who knows who the deed has done?&rdquo;<br />
They faltered forth; then answered John:<br />
&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t prove who did it, I<br />
Will hang for it most willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak out,&rdquo; they cried.&nbsp; Said John:
&ldquo;Last night,<br />
Being in bed, I saw a light;<br />
I rose, as if I&rsquo;d had a call&mdash;<br />
There was a hole in the house wall,<br />
&rsquo;Gainst which his back a certain friar<br />
Placed, thereby blinding it entire,<br />
Lest, as he said, some curious eye<br />
From the next house their deeds should spy.<br />
I cut, meanwhile, to him unknown,<br />
A large round piece from off his gown.<br />
To prove that what I&rsquo;ve said is true<br />
I&rsquo;ve in my pouch the piece to shew.&rdquo;<br />
<!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>The merchants then were soon set free;<br />
The murderers died on gallows tree.</p>
<p>All three depart from Market Jew,<br />
Together with their comrade true,<br />
Far as Kuz carn na Huila went,<br />
And thence their ways lay different.<br />
Now though the merchants earnest were<br />
That John should with them home repair,<br />
He steadfastly refused their plea,<br />
Longing his wife and home to see.</p>
<p>When of the merchants he lost sight<br />
He lounged away his time till night.<br />
He&rsquo;d fain know whether, while he roved<br />
Abroad, his consort faithful proved.</p>
<p>Arrived, he listened at the door,<br />
And heard a man&rsquo;s voice, he was sure,<br />
Within the bed; his knife he drew,<br />
Resolved to slay the guilty two.<br />
But soon remembering the advice,<br />
&ldquo;<i>Ere striking once</i>, <i>bethink thee
twice</i>,&rdquo;<br />
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>In hurry from the door he strode,<br />
But soon returning knocked aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In name of God, who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she cried;<br
/>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis I am here, wife,&rdquo; John replied.<br />
(&ldquo;Now in the name of blest Marie,<br />
Whom heard I in her company?&rdquo;)<br />
&ldquo;If John thou art, pray enter free.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;First bring the light here,&rdquo; answered he.<br />
&rsquo;Twas brought, he stepped the threshold o&rsquo;er.<br />
Quoth he: &ldquo;On coming to the door<br />
I heard a man&rsquo;s voice in the bed.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Ah, Johnny, when away you sped<br />
In distant parts for work to roam,<br />
I then with child was three months gone;<br />
In bed there lies a comely boy,<br />
Unto us both he&rsquo;ll be a joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said John, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something to disclose.<br />
My master, when I left his house,<br />
Gave me this cake I have in hand,<br />
And with it gave the strict command<br />
<!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>When I with thee should merry make<br />
Then and not till then it to break.<br />
I&rsquo;ll now accomplish what he bade,<br />
Mayhap we&rsquo;ve wherefor to be glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They broke the cake in anxious haste,<br />
The nine pounds in it, lo! were placed.<br />
They took the money, ate the bread,<br />
And I for truth have heard it said<br />
No quarrel e&rsquo;er or noisy word<br />
&rsquo;Twixt them from that time forth occurr&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Gentles all, my tale is done,<br />
I hope it has your favour won!</p>

19</span>SIR VERNER AND DAME INGEBORG</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
Linholm&rsquo;s house<br />
The swains they were drinking and making carouse.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The Dames ne&rsquo;er could so gallant a prisoner
keep in</i>.</p>
<p>The swains they drank deep and they made themselves gay,<br />
And so did Sir Verner in prison that lay.</p>
<p>Dame Ingeborg woke, and she lifts up her eyes:<br />
&ldquo;O, which of my maidens doth sing in that guise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, none of your maidens can sing in such guise,<br />
&rsquo;Tis Sir Verner who&rsquo;s singing, in durance he
lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Dame Ingeborg straightway two servants addressed:<br />
&ldquo;To come to my presence Sir Verner request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In through the portal Sir Verner he strode,<br />
And up to receive him Dame Ingeborg stood.</p>
<p>To the cushion Dame Ingeborg points with a smile:<br />
&ldquo;Go thither, Sir Verner, and rest thee awhile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hark thou, Sir Verner, what I to thee say:<br />
I beg thou wilt sing me a pretty love lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A love lay I&rsquo;ve never learnt up to this hour,<br
/>
But I&rsquo;ll sing to oblige thee the best in my
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Verner began, and he sang such a lay,<br />
That soon in deep slumber Dame Ingeborg lay.</p>
<p>The Dames and the maids fell to sleep and to doze,<br />
Dame Ingeborg sank to a peaceful repose.</p>
<p>Sir Verner he glanced then so cautiously round,<br />
The keys great and small in a nook he has found.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>To the door hied Sir Verner as fast as he might,<br />
He forgot to bid Dame Ingeborg a good-night.</p>
<p>When out of the castle himself he perceived,<br />
His voice in a ditty again he upheaved.</p>
<p>Sir Verner he waved up his hat with delight:<br />
&ldquo;Dame Ingeborg bid ye a very good night!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hear thou, Sir Warden, who stand&rsquo;st on thy
watch,<br />
Of my ditty the burden I pray thee to catch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d this e&rsquo;en not have taken a bushel of
gold,<br />
Now no penny for me shall she ever behold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So fast to the door went Sir Verner the knight,<br />
He forgot to bid Damsel or Lady good-night.</p>

<p>Yestere&rsquo;en when the bat, and the owl, and his mate,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Were holding discourse their small matters about;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sun, that the wee little stars might shine
out,<br />
Had extinguished the lamp of his lustre so great.</p>
<p>A shepherd exclaimed: &ldquo;O &rsquo;twas folly that I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My love should bestow upon one never kind,<br />

Would suffer unmoved a true lover to die.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
